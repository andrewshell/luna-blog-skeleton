title: About Luna
---
Luna is a flat-file CMS created by [Andrew Shell](http://blog.andrewshell.org).

The goal of Luna is to be a clean, object oriented library that can be used on it's own for a website or blog or used in another application to handle parsing and rendering of content in other interesting ways.

This site is a skeleton that can be used for people to create their own blog using Luna.
